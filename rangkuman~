// variabel
5 \* 2
-1
5 is operand or argument
2 is operand or argument

- operator - is binary
- operator  -1 is unary

* can be used for combine string

//conditional and loop statements
- break
  will stop whole loop
- continue 
  not stop whole loop.

// array and function
- for of
  can be used for looping
- for in
  ?
- function declaration
  when created function but not assign into variabel.
- function expression
  when created function but anonymous / doesnt have name, assign that to a variabel.
- rest parameter
  allow function to accept argumen in unlimited quantity
- nested function and closure
  inner function has access to variable and parameter of its outer function.
- currying
  ?
- recrusive
  a function call itself
- arrow function
  provide us with an alternative way to write a shorter syntax to create function

// OOP
- what is object
  object having state and behavior (properties, method)
- for in
  used for looping to get key cannot get value instead.
- desctructing assignment
  for unpack values from array or properties from objects [a,b] = [10, 11]
- spread operator (...)
  for copy all part of array or object into new array or object
- this?
  sometime use this is undifined.
- what is class 
  class are a template for creating objects, class are in fact "special functions"
- class declaration
  class User {}
- class expression
  const User = class {}
- create an object from class
  Must use new ex. const user = new User()
- private properties
  using "#". private properties cannot be access from outside or from inheriting classes.
  
// data structure
- basic data structure
  techniques for storing and organaizing data, make easier to modify navigate and acces.
- used for  
  - manage and utilize large dataset
  - search fir particular data from a database.
  - design algorithms
  - handle multiple request from users at once.
  - simplify and speed up data processing
- primitive data structure
  boolean, null, number, string, etc
- non primitive data structure 
  not define by the programming language , these include linear data structure ~
  like queue and linked lists.
- stack
  last in first out 
- queue 
  first in first out  
- set 
  doesnt allow duplicate values.
- assign Set  
  using new Set(arr)
- hash table
  ?
- map
  ?
- linked lists
  is linear data structure

// algorithm
- how to use algorithms to solve problems
  - understand the problems
    - know its inputs and expected outputs
    - understand what condition and/or parameter are given
  - strategize
  - implement
- what is pseudocode
  - easier-to-understand version of programming language
  - we can express detailed step by step procees in a much simpler language
- notation
  - O(1) constant
  - O(log n) logarithm N  
  - O(n) linear
  - O(n2) square 2
  - O(nN) N square n
- sort 
  - Linear search
    secara berurutan
  - Binary search
    data harus diurutkan
  - Jump search
  - Interpolation search
  - Exponential search
  - Sublist search
  - Fibonanci search
